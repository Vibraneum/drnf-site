## What Makes This EA-Aligned

### Traditional NGO Approach

- Vague impact claims ("helping thousands")
- Hidden overhead costs
- Limited transparency
- "Trust us" mentality

### Effective Altruism Approach (What DRNF Now Has)
- ✅ Emotional storytelling **+ data**
- ✅ Specific, measurable impact (500-600 daily, ₹2/cup)
- ✅ Transparent overhead (~5%)
- ✅ Complete transparency page
- ✅ "Verify us" mentality with evidence

### Key Differentiators
1. **Cost-Per-Impact Clarity**: Donors know exactly what ₹1,000 accomplishes
2. **Scalability Transparency**: Clear path from 2 counters → 270+ counters
3. **Conservative Estimates**: Ranges (500-600) instead of inflated numbers
4. **Methodology Disclosure**: How we count, calculate, and verify
5. **Counterfactual Framing**: What wouldn't happen without DRNF
