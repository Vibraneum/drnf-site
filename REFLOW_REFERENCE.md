**Date**: November 13, 2025
**Issue**: User mentioned "reflow" as a source for images
**Status**: Investigating possible references

## Possible Interpretations

### 1. "Reflow" as Organization Name
**Analysis**: No direct connection found between DRNF and an organization called "Reflow"

**Checked**:
- Not mentioned in CLAUDE.md
- Not in partnership list
- Not in website content

**Conclusion**: Unlikely to be a partner organization

---

### 2. "Reflow" as Typo/Autocorrect

**Possible intended words**:

#### Option A: "LooCafe"
**Likelihood**: HIGH
- "Reflow" could be autocorrect for "LooCafe"
- LooCafe is major partner (270+ locations)
- Primary source for chai counter images
- Referenced throughout documentation

**Recommendation**: Use LooCafe (https://loocafe.com)

#### Option B: "Refill" / "Refresh"
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
- Could mean "refresh/refill images"
- Context: "refresh images using internet searches"
- Not an organization, just instruction clarification

---

### 3. Environmental/Sustainability Initiative

**Possibility**: "Reflow" as sustainability term
- Reflow refers to circular economy concepts
- Relevant to LooCafe's sustainability model
- Could refer to:
  - Recycling/upcycling initiatives
  - Circular economy programs
  - Waste management systems

**Connection to DRNF**:
- LooCafe uses recycled shipping containers
- Environmental conservation programs
- Sustainability focus in foundation work

**Recommendation**: Check environmental program photos

### 4. Technical Term (Web Development)

**Browser Reflow**: Layout recalculation in web browsers
**Likelihood**: LOW
- Not relevant to image sourcing
- Technical CSS/JavaScript term
- Doesn't match context of image downloads

**Conclusion**: Not the intended meaning
