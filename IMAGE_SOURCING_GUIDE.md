```bash

mkdir -p images/ixora
mkdir -p images/chai-counters
mkdir -p images/community
mkdir -p images/workers
mkdir -p images/stock-placeholders
```

### Step 2: Rename Files Descriptively

**Bad naming**: `IMG_1234.jpg`, `photo.png`, `untitled.jpg`

**Good naming**:
- `loocafe-facility-hero-kbr-park.jpg`
- `chai-counter-service-action.jpg`
- `ppe-distribution-covid-2020.jpg`
- `worker-portrait-cleaning-staff.jpg`

### Step 3: Optimize Images

Use online tools or command line:

**Online Tools**:
- TinyPNG: https://tinypng.com (compress JPG/PNG)
- Squoosh: https://squoosh.app (advanced optimization)
- CloudConvert: https://cloudconvert.com (format conversion)

**Target specifications**:
- **File size**: < 200KB per image
- **Format**: JPG for photos, PNG for logos/transparency
- **Quality**: 80-85% compression
- **Dimensions**: Match required sizes from ASSET_NEEDS_LIST.md

**Command line (ImageMagick)**:
```bash
# Resize and compress
convert input.jpg -resize 1920x800 -quality 85 output.jpg

# Batch process all JPGs in directory
mogrify -resize 1200x800 -quality 85 *.jpg
```

### Step 4: Add Alt Text & HTML Comments

When adding to HTML:

```html
<!-- LooCafe Partnership - Asset #1 from loocafe.com -->
<img
  src="images/loocafe/loocafe-facility-hero.jpg"
  alt="LooCafe sustainable public toilet facility in Hyderabad's KBR Park area"
  loading="lazy"
  width="1920"
  height="800"
>
```

**Alt text guidelines**:

## Part 9: Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't Find High-Quality Images

**Solutions**:
1. Contact organization directly: info@drnf.org or hello@ixoragroup.com
2. Check social media (Facebook, LinkedIn) for high-res versions
3. Use stock photos as temporary placeholders
4. Request professional photo shoot

### Issue: Images Are Too Large

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Compress using ImageMagick
convert input.jpg -quality 85 output.jpg

# Resize to web dimensions
convert input.jpg -resize 1920x output.jpg

# Batch process
for img in *.jpg; do
  convert "$img" -quality 85 -resize 1920x "optimized-$img"
done
```

### Issue: Images Look Blurry

**Causes**:
- Original resolution too low
- Over-compression
- Incorrect dimensions

**Solutions**:
1. Find higher resolution source
2. Use 90% quality instead of 85%
3. Ensure 2x resolution for retina displays

### Issue: Wrong Aspect Ratio

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Crop to specific aspect ratio (16:9)
convert input.jpg -gravity center -crop 16:9 output.jpg

# Resize with padding
convert input.jpg -resize 1920x800 -gravity center -extent 1920x800 -background white output.jpg
```
