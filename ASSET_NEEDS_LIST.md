# DRNF Website - Asset Needs & Placeholder Strategy

**Date**: November 7, 2025
**Purpose**: Track all images needed, placeholder sources, and replacement plan
**Status**: Using stock/online images with placeholders for later replacement

---

## 📸 IMAGE SOURCING STRATEGY

### Approach: Multi-Source
1. **Free Stock Photos** (Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay) - Professional placeholders
2. **Online Attribution** (News articles, public photos) - Real DRNF content when available
3. **Placeholder Text** - Clear indication of what real image should replace it
4. **Future Replacement** - Easy to swap with actual DRNF photos later
