---

## What Was Rejected

### ❌ Branch 3: Effective Altruism Ideology (REJECTED ENTIRELY)

**Why Rejected**: Fundamental misalignment with DRNF's mission and values

**Branch 3 Attempted to Add**:
1. "Why LooCafe is Effective Altruism in Action" (114 lines)
   - Self-assessed "9.5/10 EA score" without external validation
   - EA framework (Neglectedness, Scalability, Tractability)

2. "Traditional Charity vs. Sustainable Impact" (180 lines)
   - Binary red (bad) vs. green (good) comparison
   - Judgmental framing: "Perpetual Dependency Model" vs. "Self-Sustaining Ecosystem"
   - Dismisses all traditional charity as creating "Zero Jobs, Unsustainable"

3. **"Free Chai as Smart Customer Acquisition"** (127 lines) - **Most Problematic**
   - Reframes serving homeless as business strategy
   - Business metrics: "10-15% estimated conversion," "foot traffic driver"
   - Uses ROI language: "₹2 cost per cup," "₹∞ sustainable loop"
   - **Fabricated quote** attributed to Abhishek Nath: "strategic compassion"

**Critical Issues**:
1. **Ideological Overreach**: Imposes Western EA philosophy not part of DRNF's Indian seva tradition
2. **Exploitative Framing**: Treats vulnerable people as marketing tools for LooCafe sales
3. **Mission Drift**: Transforms compassionate service into transactional business strategy
4. **Fabricated Content**: Quote attributed to founder without verification
5. **Unverified Claims**: Self-assessed EA score, unverifiable statistics

**From CLAUDE.md**:
> "This website is an information-focused showcase... Community-centered: All content should emphasize community service and compassion"

**Branch 3 violated this by**:
- Reframing charity as "customer acquisition" and "conversion optimization"
- Using business jargon (ROI, foot traffic, strategic compassion) instead of compassionate language
- Creating false dichotomy that alienates traditional NGO partners

**User's Decision**:
- Extended thinking analysis confirmed: No salvageable content (all sections require >85% rewriting)
- Faster to write new content than to "fix" this
- Even with modifications, core framing remains problematic

**Subagent Verdict**: **REJECT ENTIRELY** - "The entire branch treats social impact as business strategy"

## Merge Conflicts Resolved

### Files with Conflicts:
1. `frontline-workers.html` - 1 conflict
2. `loocafe-impact.html` - 4 conflicts

### Resolution Strategy:

#### frontline-workers.html (1 conflict resolved):
**Conflict**: Lines 148-154 (Ixora stats card)
- **Branch 4 version**: "2000+<sup>1</sup>" with citation, "Staff & Families Supported"
- **Branch 1 version**: "2,000+" with comma, "Facility Management Staff"
- **Resolution**: Kept Branch 1 - clearer formatting, more accurate label
- **Rationale**: Family estimate shown separately with proper calculation footnote

#### loocafe-impact.html (4 conflicts resolved):

**1. Navigation Section**
- **Conflict**: Different nav structures
- **Resolution**: Kept Branch 1's simpler navigation
- **Rationale**: Site-wide consistency

**2. References Section**
- **Conflict**: Branch 4 had references, Branch 1 didn't
- **Resolution**: Kept Branch 4's complete references section
- **Rationale**: All 15 citations are valuable for credibility

**3. Footer Structure**
- **Conflict**: Different footer classes and year
- **Resolution**: Kept Branch 1's footer (year 2025, proper structure)
- **Rationale**: Matches site-wide footer format

**4. Back-to-Top Button**
- **Conflict**: Different button IDs (`back-to-top` vs `backToTop`)
- **Resolution**: Kept Branch 1's `backToTop`
- **Rationale**: Matches JavaScript in main.js

### Merge Philosophy:
**Keep the best of both branches** - All valuable content preserved:
- ✅ All citations and research from Branch 4
- ✅ All content enhancements from Branch 1
- ✅ Consistent structure throughout
- ✅ Accurate statistics with transparent footnotes

## User Guidance Applied

### 1. Gates Foundation Claim
**User**: "remove this claim"
**Action**: Removed "exclusive partner" language entirely
**Result**: Changed to "Gates Foundation Partner" (partnership confirmed, exclusivity claim removed)

### 2. Family Members Statistic
**User**: "use calculated estimate"
**Action**: Added transparent calculation: "~8,000 (est: 2,000+ staff × avg. 4 family members)"
**Result**: Clear methodology shown with asterisk footnote

### 3. Fabricated Quote
**User**: "no, fabricated"
**Action**: Branch 3 rejected entirely (quote was central to problematic section)
**Result**: No fabricated content made it into production

### 4. Effective Altruism Affiliation
**User**: "Yes, keep, but we cannot use branding, we can use them as a source"
**Action**: Removed all EA branding, kept evidence-based methodology
**Result**:
- "Effective Altruism" → "Evidence-Based Impact"
- EA principles applied but not branded
- EA cited in internal documentation as methodology source

### 5. Target Audience
**User**: "All" (Indian donors, Western donors, Corporate CSR)
**Action**: Ensured content works for all audiences
**Result**: Removed Western-centric EA jargon, kept universal transparency principles

### 6. Branch 3 Salvageability
**User**: "if you feel there is any value, in changing that words or anything else, use extended thinking"
**Action**: Deployed specialized subagent for extended analysis
**Result**: Subagent concluded >85% rewriting needed, faster to write new content
**Final Decision**: REJECT ENTIRELY
