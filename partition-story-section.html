                    In 1905, Rai Bahadur Mul Raj purchased a bungalow in Lahore that he named "Willows." This wasn't just a family home - it became an active intellectual and cultural center where the brightest minds of Punjab gathered. Here, the future of India was debated, institutions were conceived, and movements were born.

                        <strong style="color: #e53e3e;">August 1947.</strong> The subcontinent was being torn apart. In Lahore, communal violence had reached horrifying levels. Dr. Prem Nath (Mul Raj's son) and his family were in grave danger.

                        <strong>The Conspiracy:</strong> Muslim neighbors, aware of the family's wealth and property, were plotting to kill them and seize their assets. In the chaos of Partition, such murders were common - and often went unpunished.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <strong style="color: #e53e3e;">But fate intervened.</strong> Dr. Prem Nath overheard the conspiracy. He had hours, not days. In desperation, he called his brother - <strong>Air Marshal Ajit Nath</strong>, who was serving in the Indian Armed Forces.

                        Air Marshal Ajit Nath acted with military precision. Using his position and contacts, he arranged for an <strong style="color: #e53e3e;">emergency airlift evacuation</strong>. Through the night, family members were quietly gathered and rushed to the airfield.

                        <strong>Dawn broke.</strong> As the plane lifted off from Lahore, the family looked down at the city that had been their home for generations. Below them lay "Willows," the V.V.R.I. Institute, their lands, their wealth, their history. They would never return.
